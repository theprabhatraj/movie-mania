Movie-Mania is a website that allows users to easily find and discover movies that they are interested in watching. The website is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for a fast and responsive user experience. It also utilizes an API (Application Programming Interface) to pull in movie data from external sources, such as IMDb.

Users can search for movies by title, genre, actor, director, or release year. The search results will display a list of movies that match the user's criteria, with information such as the movie's title, release date, rating, and a brief plot summary. By clicking on a movie title, users will be redirected to the IMDb page for that movie, where they can view more detailed information such as cast, reviews, ratings and trailers.

Movie-Mania also features a "Top Rated" section, where users can see the highest rated movies on the website, and a "Watchlist" where users can create a list of movies they want to watch in the future.

The website is regularly updated with new movies, so users can always find something new to watch. With its user-friendly interface and access to detailed movie information, Movie-Mania is a great resource for movie lovers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
